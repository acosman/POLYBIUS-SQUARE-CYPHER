README for ADFGVX File Encryption Project

Overview
The ADFGVX File Encryption Project, developed in Java, provides a suite of tools for encrypting and decrypting files using the ADFGVX cipher, a classic encryption method. The project consists of several classes, each serving a specific purpose within the encryption process.

Features
Menu-driven Interface: Users interact with the system through a console-based menu, making it easy to navigate and use.
File Management: Read and write functionalities for file handling.
Encryption & Decryption: Core operations using the ADFGVX cipher.
Interactive Mode: Directly encrypt or decrypt text via user input.
Key Management: Create and manage encryption keys.

Components
Menu Class (ie.atu.sw.Menu): Provides the main interface for user interaction. It handles menu display and option selection.
FileManager Class (ie.atu.sw.FileManager): Manages file operations, including reading from and writing to files, and handling directories.
Cypher Class (ie.atu.sw.Cypher): Contains methods for encrypting and decrypting text using the ADFGVX cipher. Offers both interactive and file-based operations.
CreateKey Class (ie.atu.sw.CreateKey): Responsible for generating and managing the cipher keys.
Communicator Class (ie.atu.sw.Communicator): Facilitates communication with the user, handling input and displaying messages.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Download the project files to your local machine.
Compile the Java Classes: Ensure all classes are compiled and ready to run.
Run the Application: Start the application by running the Menu class.

Usage
Navigate the Menu: Use the menu to choose between different operations like setting up directories, creating keys, encrypting, and decrypting files.
Specify Directories: Define input and output directories for file operations.
Create a Key: Generate a key for the ADFGVX cipher.
Encrypt/Decrypt Files: Choose to encrypt or decrypt files in the specified directories.
Interactive Mode: Directly input text for immediate encryption or decryption.

Dependencies
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Basic knowledge of Java and command-line operations
